\usage{
plotDotplot(barycoords, Gdiffexp = rownames(barycoords), Goi = NULL,
  Coi = attr(barycoords, "conditions"), colorby = "diffexp",
  colorvalues = NULL, rmax = 5, sizevalues = c(T = 2, F = 0.5),
  alphavalues = c(T = 0.8, F = 0.8), barycoords2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{barycoords}{Dataframe containing for every gene its barycentric coordinates, as return by \code{transformBarycentric}}

\item{Gdiffexp}{Differentially expressed genes}

\item{Goi}{Genes of interest, a character or numeric vector to plot one set of genes, a named list to plot multiple gene lists}

\item{Coi}{Character vector specifying the names of the three biological conditions}

\item{colorby}{Color by differential expression ("diffexp") or by log fold-change ("z")}

\item{colorvalues}{Colors used according to colorby}

\item{sizevalues}{List with the size of each dot if differentially expressed (`T`) or not (`F`)}

\item{alphavalues}{List with the alpha value of each dot if differentially expressed or not}

\item{barycoords2}{Dataframe containing for every gene a second set of barycentric coordinates, as returned by \code{transformBarycentric}. An arrow will be drawn from the coordinates in `barycoords` to those in `barycoords2`}
}
\value{
Dataframe containing for every original point its new x and y coordinates in barycentric space
